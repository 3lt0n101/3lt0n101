# Hi, I'm Elton  
**Aspiring Robotics & Software Developer | Self-Taught Tech Explorer**

### About Me
I'm on a solo journey learning software and electronics by building real-world projects. From smart gloves to maze solvers, I explore, break, and rebuild ideas in Python, Arduino, and web tech.

### Skills
- Python (with Pygame, recursion, basic data structures)
- Arduino & Circuit Design
- HTML/CSS
- Logical thinking and problem solving
- Learning Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, and Robotics

### Projects
- **Smart Exo-Glove (In Progress)** â€“ Arduino-powered glove for hand support
- **Maze Solver** â€“ Python pathfinding with visualization
- **Quote Generator** â€“ JavaScript web mini-app
- **Fibonacci Visualizer** â€“ Recursive animation in Python

### Goals
- Get into the Advance Africa Scholarship & pursue Data Science or Web Dev
- Build tools that support people with physical challenges
- Eventually build a game based on my Zion mythology
